## Installation

* Tab Wrangler for Chrome:
  https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/egnjhciaieeiiohknchakcodbpgjnchh
* Tab Wrangler for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabwrangler/

## Features

* *The Corral*: Stores tabs which have been auto-closed so you can re-open as required.
* *Exclude list*: Provide the urls or domain names of the sites you never want auto-closed.
* *Tab Lock*: Pick open tabs to "lock".  Locked tabs will not be auto-closed.
* *Configurable*: Pick how long a tab should be considered ready to close and how many tabs should
  be open at a minimum.
* *Smart*: Doesn't autoclose pinned tabs, doesn't close all your tabs, just enough to make your
  browser usable.

## Usage

1. Click on the icon next to the URL bar
    * Tab Corral
      * Stores tabs which have been auto-closed. Restoring tabs with green leaf icons on their right
        sides will have their full history and scroll positions saved. (Full history restore is
        limited by the browser to the last 25 closed tabs.)
    * Tab Lock
      * Selectively lock tabs which you want to stay open.
      * See the time remaining before each tab will be checked for auto-closing.
    * Options
      * Whitelist certain URLs to never be closed.
      * Set the amount of time to wait before closing inactive tabs.
      * Set the ideal number of tabs to have in your browser.
      * Configure keyboard shortcuts.

tabs that you wanted to save.

2. Switch to the *Settings* tab
3. Scroll to *Import / Export*
4. Click *Import*

all of your logged in browser sessions if you have sync enabled. Their possible values and their

## Privacy Policy

Tab Wrangler does not transmit any data about you or your usage of Tab Wrangler. There is no
tracking, there are no analytics, and there are no advertisements.

Tab Wrangler **does not have** nor does it request the ability to read information on the web
pages that you visit. Tab Wrangler is able to read the title and current location (the URL) of
your tabs but not the content inside those tabs.

### Explanation of Requested Permissions

Tab Wrangler's requested permissions are listed in its [manifest.json][manifest.json] under the
`"permissions"` key.

* [`"alarms"`][7]: Allows creation of alarms to periodically check Tab Wrangler's background script
  that checks for stale tabs is running and healthy.
* [`"contextMenus"`][3]: Allows a "Tab Wrangler" menu item when you right click on a webpage that
  lets you send the tab to the Tab Corral, lock that tab, or lock all tabs on that domain.
* [`"sessions"`][4]: Allows Tab Wrangler to read and restore the full history of a tab including
  enabling the back/forward buttons and your scroll position on the page.
* [`"storage"`][5]: Allows Tab Wrangler to sync your Tab Wrangler settings with your browser
  account and enables saving your closed tabs to your local computer. *Note: closed tabs are not
  synced because the "sync" storage area has only a small amount of storage.*
* [`"tabs"`][6]: Allows Tab Wrangler to read the title and location of any current tabs as well
  as close those tabs and open new tabs. This permission **does not** enable Tab Wrangler to
  read information on web pages that you visit.
