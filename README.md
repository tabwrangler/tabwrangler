# Tab Wrangler

Auto-closes tabs which you haven't used in awhile.

## Features:

* *The Corral*: Stores tabs which have been auto-closed so you can re-open as required.
* *Exclude list*: Provide the urls or domain names of the sites you never want auto-closed.
* *Tab Lock*: Pick open tabs to "lock".  Locked tabs will not be auto-closed.
* *Configurable*: Pick how long a tab should be considered ready to close and how many tabs should be open at a minimum. 
* *Smart*: Doesn't autoclose pinned tabs, doesn't close all your tabs,
  just enough to make your browser usable.
